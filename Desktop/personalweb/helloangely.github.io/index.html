      <br> Hi there, I'm a fourth year undergraduate studying Computer Science and specializing in Intelligent Systems. My focus area is comprised of what we would consider in our modern society as robotics. 
    </br>
    <br>
      To answer your question right now, yes, robots are going to take over the world.Â Exploring the vast unknown of our horizon on AI is like seeing further into the universe. The more we explore, the more we don't know. I find it exciting to be given a challenge that can transform how we live today. </br>
